* TODO Milestones
** Setup Database

*** What Database are you going to use?
At this point, I see that I should go ahead and use SQLite
*** TODO I need some form of tag reader
**** Taglib (C++)
+ Fast
+ No dependencies
+ Supports MP3, Vorbis, Flac, MPC, Speex, WavPack, TrueAudio, WAV, AIFF, MP4 and ASF
- Requires a bridge between java and c++
**** ealvatag (Java)
+ Written in Java
+ Supports MP3, Flac, Vorbis, Mp4, Aiff, Wav, Wma, and DSF
- Requires Dependencies to run
- Slower  
*** How should audio data be stored in a database?
- ID - incrementing uint32_t, each track has a unique id.
- Track Title -- Variable String
- Track Number -- int32_t
- Artist Name -- Variable String
- Album Artist Name -- Variable String
- Album Name -- Variable String
- Year -- either uint16_t or uint32_t
- location in file_path -- Variable String
*** TODO Setup a database connector
** Test Audio playback
*** Read about MediaPlayer and how it works
** Test File System Navigation
